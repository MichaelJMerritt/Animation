# 4. Animation

Often showing patterns in data that changes with time can be made more effective with animation.  There are other times when showing a concept is easier with animation.

GitHub doesn't support in-web viewing of video at the moment and some animation files are too large to upload in GIF form.  I'd be happy to show you more when we speak!

When presenting cyclic data it can help to overlay each cycle's data on top of each other and watch for changes.  It is easy to visualize slow drift in signals in this manner, and this type of inspection will also make seeing outliers or otherwise odd behavior in data.

Digging deep into data often uncovers details that aren't noticeable when looking at summaries, take the 2020 Presidential Election summary for instance.  Showing a map with the states colored according to who won that state is an effective image for showing how each candidate received their electoral votes, but does it provide any insight as to how the populace voted?

Parsing the voting results data by county and then shading each county along a continuous color scale allows us to inspect the voting results in detail without cluttering the chart.  Many states show large areas of muted colors that indicate close races with darker regions indicating strongholds for each candidate.  The chart is still simple and easy to read but shows much more information.
